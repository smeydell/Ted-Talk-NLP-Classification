**Objective**
To automatically categorize/tag TED Talk videos and identify key topics/trends based on a series of features provided in a sample dataset, link below. Once the text data has been cleaned and prepared, a series Classification models will be trained on the sample dataset.

There are two datasets provided: the main summary and the transcripts

**TED Talks: Summary** https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks?select=ted_main.csv

**TED Talks: Transcripts** https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks?select=transcripts.csv

**Problem Statement**
The data provided, in its raw format, does not make for easy classification and statistical analysis of the various TED Talks. There is no easy way to decipher trends in popular talk topics, categories, or to further explore specific speakers, their occupations, and general talk focus (transcript summary).

**Benefit of Analysis**
Being able to peel back and examine various layers of details within the dataset to isolate key trends, categories, or any other features of interest would be beneficial to the analyst/user in answering a series of questions, often addressed by some of the best and brightest minds in the world and their respective TED talks.

Being able to quickly classify and assign a given TED talk, based on other similar feature patterns, would allow for improved viewer experiences from accurate user preference alignment as it relates to Tags, Ratings, and Comment popularity (counts).
